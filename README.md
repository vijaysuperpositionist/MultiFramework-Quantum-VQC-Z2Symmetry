This repository implements and compares Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) architectures for detecting Zâ‚‚ parity symmetry in toy Hamiltonians across three major quantum frameworks:

PennyLane (IBM backend) â€” full classical simulation and circuit cost convergence analysis
Cirq (Google backend) â€” implemented with both gradient-free and gradient-based optimization
Qiskit (IBM Composer + Aer simulator + real device) â€” results from real IBM Quantum backends

Key Features:

Dataset builder for Zâ‚‚-symmetric and asymmetric Hamiltonians

Angle encoding of features via RY gates

Cost function convergence plots and ROC curves

Threshold tuning for classifier outputs

Cirq implementation using both gradient-based and gradient-free methods

Real quantum hardware job run via IBM Composer (Sherbrooke backend)
