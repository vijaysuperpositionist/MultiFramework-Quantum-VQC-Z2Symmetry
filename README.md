Variational Quantum Learning of Hidden Symmetries in Quantum Hamiltonians: Enabling Improved Ansatz Design and Error Robustness in Near-Term Quantum Systems.
Quantum Symmetry Classifier ‚Äì 2-Qubit VQC (Pennylane)
This project implements a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) using Pennylane to identify symmetry properties of quantum Hamiltonians. It serves as a proof-of-concept for symmetry detection via quantum machine learning and will be submitted to IEEE QCE25.

What We‚Äôve Done (So Far)
üì¶ Environment Setup

Created and isolated a pennylane_env using Anaconda

Installed pennylane, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and Qiskit simulators

‚öôÔ∏è Model Architecture

Built a 2-qubit classifier circuit using a basic ansatz:

RY(x) encoding for features

RY(weights) for trainable parameters

CNOT entanglement between qubits

Output: ‚ü®Z‚ü© expectation on qubit 0

Training Loop

Implemented custom loss with soft labels (0.9/0.1)

Added L2 regularization

Integrated validation loss tracking

Saved loss history to loss_log.csv

Added live plotting of training vs validation loss

Generalization Measures

Introduced noise via default.mixed device

Tuned for generalization using early stopping

Logged best-performing weights during training

 Evaluation

Used accuracy_score and roc_auc_score on a holdout set

Visualized raw circuit predictions

Simulated final model on qiskit.aer for a hardware-matching backend

Outcome

Stable loss convergence

Clear separation of output expectations across symmetry classes

AUC = 1.0 on test data with only 2-qubit model

Ready for real-hardware execution
