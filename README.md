Variational Quantum Learning of Hidden Symmetries in Quantum Hamiltonians: Enabling Improved Ansatz Design and Error Robustness in Near-Term Quantum Systems.
Quantum Symmetry Classifier ‚Äì 2-Qubit VQC (Pennylane)
This project implements a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) using Pennylane to identify symmetry properties of quantum Hamiltonians. It serves as a proof-of-concept for symmetry detection via quantum machine learning and will be submitted to IEEE QCE25.

What We‚Äôve Done (So Far)
üì¶ Environment Setup

Created and isolated a pennylane_env using Anaconda

Installed pennylane, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and Qiskit simulators

‚öôÔ∏è Model Architecture

Built a 2-qubit classifier circuit using a basic ansatz:

RY(x) encoding for features

RY(weights) for trainable parameters

CNOT entanglement between qubits

Output: ‚ü®Z‚ü© expectation on qubit 0

Training Loop

Implemented custom loss with soft labels (0.9/0.1)

Added L2 regularization

Integrated validation loss tracking

Saved loss history to loss_log.csv

Added live plotting of training vs validation loss

Generalization Measures

Introduced noise via default.mixed device

Tuned for generalization using early stopping

Logged best-performing weights during training

 Evaluation

Used accuracy_score and roc_auc_score on a holdout set

Visualized raw circuit predictions

Simulated final model on qiskit.aer for a hardware-matching backend

Outcome

Stable loss convergence

Clear separation of output expectations across symmetry classes

Tested Google Cirq with and without Gradient
 Variational Quantum Classifier for Z‚ÇÇ Symmetry Detection (Cirq Implementation)
This notebook implements a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) using Google‚Äôs Cirq framework to detect Z‚ÇÇ parity symmetry in synthetic Hamiltonian feature encodings. The same classifier architecture is adapted from the PennyLane version for comparative benchmarking.

üìå Project Highlights
Quantum Framework: Cirq (1.5.0)

Symmetry Target: Z‚ÇÇ parity (detect if qubit rotations are symmetric across features)

Backend: Cirq Simulator (state vector)

Optimization Strategies:

Gradient-Free: Nelder-Mead

Gradient-Based: Manual Finite-Difference

"Tested on real IBM Quantum hardware (ibm_sherbrooke) with 10,000 shots. Results exhibited uniform probability distribution across Z‚ÇÇ symmetry pairs ‚Äî confirming our handcrafted VQC circuit preserves parity."

AUC = 1.0 on test data with only 2-qubit model

Ready for real-hardware execution
